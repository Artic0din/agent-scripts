# and skills/fleet-maintenance/scripts/agent-skill-links-audit.sh.
#
# These two tools must agree: the audit reports drift against whatever the sync
# would create, so a value present in one and stale in the other makes the audit
# report false failures. That happened when the audit moved to the Metisary
# layout and sync-skills kept the old ~/Projects/agent-scripts literals.
#
# Paths stay $HOME-relative on purpose. scripts/test-sync-skills runs the real
# scripts under a synthetic HOME, so deriving these from the script's own
# location would resolve to the real checkout and defeat that isolation.
